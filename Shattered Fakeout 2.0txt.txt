First, we’ll implement an individual mandate to ensure that everyone has insurance—similar to the Massachusetts plan that was bipartisan and effective. Next, there will be a health insurance exchange where families can compare and choose affordable plans, with a public option available for those who need it. For those below the poverty line, federal subsidies will cap premium costs at a reasonable percentage of income, paid for through a balanced combination of cost-sharing, efficiency reforms, and slight tax adjustments for the wealthiest Americans. Preventive care incentives will be built in to reduce ER visits. We’ve done the math—this will save the system billions over time while ensuring no one is left behind. There are no death panels, no rationing—just good, fair healthcare. Any questions?"

            "answer_feedback": "Let’s break this down: your healthcare plan sounds impressive—until you realize it’s the bureaucratic Frankenstein’s monster of half-measures. You’re proposing an individual mandate, which forces people to buy private insurance whether they can afford it or not. Sure, Massachusetts made it work, but Romneycare wasn’t exactly beloved by everyone. Instead of universal healthcare, you’ve got a patchwork quilt that assumes the private insurance industry will suddenly behave out of the kindness of its corporate heart. Newsflash: they won’t.\n\nThen there’s the health insurance exchange—great in theory, but if insurers keep jacking up premiums and deductibles, it becomes a glorified catalog of misery. And let’s talk about that public option. It’s supposed to provide affordable coverage for the uninsured, but if it’s underfunded or hamstrung by compromise, it’ll be the Titanic before it even sets sail.\n\nSubsidies? Fantastic—if you love filling out a thousand forms to prove you’re poor enough to deserve help. Efficiency reforms and tax adjustments for the wealthiest Americans sound nice, but good luck getting that past Congress without a food fight. Meanwhile, other countries just went with single-payer systems and called it a day. Sweden isn’t holding bake sales to fund basic healthcare.\n\nPreventive care incentives are a good idea, but they’re the garnish on an already bloated plate. Your pitch may sound responsible, but voters will see through it as ‘more of the same’—a confusing maze of premiums, co-pays, and red tape that ultimately leaves millions frustrated.\n\nIf you’re trying to please both progressives and moderates, congratulations—you’ve managed to annoy everyone equally. Maybe just rip the Band-Aid off and go universal, or double down on a free-market plan. At least then people will know where you stand. Instead, you gave them a 10-point plan that sounds like an instruction manual for building an IKEA hospital."
